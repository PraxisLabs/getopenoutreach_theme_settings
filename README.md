# getopenoutreach_theme_settings
Default theme settings for GetOpenOutreach sites

You can try out the service for free at http://getopenoutreach.com

## Usage

These settings are intended for use with Kalatheme. They mostly just set the bootstrap library to Cerulean, because blue is a pretty color.

Unfortunately, modules can't have theme dependencies, therefore you need to enable Kalatheme in Appearance (you can download it at https://drupal.org/project/kalatheme).
